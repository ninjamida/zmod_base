THIS BRANCH (main-ninjamida) IS INTENDED FOR MY OWN USE ONLY. It's generally just where I combine all my WIP stuff so I can personally use it all at the same time.
You can use it if you really want, but you're on your own if you do so. Be warned that it may be destructively rewritten at any time. If you aren't okay with that, create your own fork and merge my individual branches as you see fit (feel free to use this branch as a reference for how to handle merge conflicts).
